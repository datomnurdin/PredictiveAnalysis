# Predictive Analysis

## Project Title
SaleMax.ai

## Project Description
Getting new customers is a tough task for sales team doing B2B deals. Maintaining the existing customers and keeping them happy is an even bigger challenge. What if we are able to identify high potential prospects, alerting customer care team if the prospect-turn-customer is getting unhappy, while keeping the customer care team highly motivated to serve the customers?

Introducing SalesMax.ai. SalesMax.ai is Artificial Intelligence-powered tool that allows maximization of potential sales revenue for DHL. It uses predictive analysis and sentiment analysis at the core of its engine, which allows:
a)	Identification of high potential prospects which should be targeted by sales agent using predictive analysis
b)	Prediction of existing customers who are most likely to terminate business dealings using sentiment analysis on social media
c)	Predict which center agents are most likely to quit and the primary drivers for attrition to reduce turnover

Moving forward, SalesMax.ai is able to contribute significantly to its primary stakeholder, DHL with better prediction accuracy using larger dataset from DHL and also with greater specialization in logistics domain knowledge.
